## Description

requirment management system.
It enables quality assurance teams to create and manage their test 
cases as well as to organize them into test plans. 
These test plans allow team members to execute test cases and 
track test results dynamically.

TestLink is a GPL licensed open source project. 
All of the source code behind TestLink is freely available 
for download via SourceForge at http://www.sourceforge.net ,

## What to know before to clone/fork

Active development is done on branch testlink_1_9 branch.
Development on branch master has been stopped (long time ago)
We plan to clean up things in future (there is no ETA for this task)

## Why we have moved from Gitorious

Due to acquisition of Gitorious by Gitlab, our choice has been to move repositories here.
We want to thank a lot Gitorious people for help they have provided, and say 'Good Luck'.
