# The Passive Investor

Theories and research about the stock market have stated that the semi-strong form of market efficiency seems to hold. This means that all public information is accurately reflected in the price of an financial instrument. This makes the job of a portfolio manager primarily managing the desired risk appetite of the client and not explicitly trying to outperform the market. This fact in combination with Finance professionals all around the world looking for that 'edge' to make their investment decisions as profitable as possible, makes it so the average joe can not compete.

Therefore, the term 'Passive Investing' is often coined around. This refers to buying funds (either ETFs or Mutual Funds) that follow the index (i.e. S&P 500, Dow Jones Index) or a broad market (Developed Markets, MSCI World) for diversification benefits. This means that a sudden decrease in performance of one stock within the index does not (on average) lead to a significant decline in the index as a whole. This allows the holder to spend limited time monitoring his holdings, therefore the term 'Passive'.

With a large increase in ETFs available (over 5,000 in 2020), it can become difficult to make the best choice in what you wish to invest. There are many different providers (iShares, Vanguard, Invesco) as well as with changes to the underlying stocks (i.e. High Yield, Super Dividends, Equal Weighted). This is quickly reflected when looking for a S&P 500 ETF as there are over 20 different ETFs available.

With this program and the accompanying spreadsheet, I wish to make investment decisions easier to make and manage.

    * See example [on my phone](Images/exampleMobileView.png) or [live version](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRvMw6lNGjzWJSyM7wr1kXUiaix_rBA2GA35MsZ_g91hHVXmyvR932az0SwmhmTDCjc1Pb7Mxqi-X-s/pubhtml?gid=1365265627&single=true)

## Functionality
In this section a brief overview and instruction is given on the program as well as the spreadsheet.

### The Program
The program is able to output an overview of each fund on a seperate sheet. In this overview the following data is shown:
* The title of the fund
* A summary about the fund's purpose/goal
* Sector Holdings (% in each sector)
* Company Holdings (top 10 companies with highest %)
* Risk Statistics (several measures of risk)
    * Displayed in 3, 5 and 10 years
    * Alpha
    * Beta
    * Mean Annual Return
    * R Squared
    * Standard Deviation
    * Sharpe Ratio
    * Treynor Ratio
* Characteristics of the instrument
    * Inception date (start of fund)
    * Category
    * Total assets
    * Currency
    * Net Asset Value
    * Latest close price
* Morningstar Style Box (style of the fund)
* Last five annual returns
* Graph depicting the adjusted close prices over the last 10 years
* Last 10 years of adjusted close prices for all Tickers (hidden sheet)

The input should either be an Excel File (with solely tickers in it) or via Yahoo Finance's ETF or Mutual Fund Screener (see [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/etf/new) and [here](https://finance.yahoo.com/screener/mutualfund/new)). Note that the program <i>can not</i> handle stocks, bonds or anything else that is not a fund. This is because the data used is only available for funds and equity investing is not considered Passive Investing. 

An example of the output can be found in the GIF below. This depicts several ETFs collected from [the Top ETFs according to Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/etfs).
