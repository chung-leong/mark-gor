# LumiBee_beta

This is a WIP project.
Here you can find:
-all the 3d printable parts as STL;
-all the non 3d printable parts;
-the PCB eagle files;
-the arduino firmware;
-the chitubox profiles;
-the Android APP beta. Note: the current app stores the PNGs in the app directly, so you must put all your layers in the
RES\drawables folder manually, then compile. I plan to implement the ability to select files from a folder 
from the App, but at the moment, all the LumiBee development (hardware, software, firmware, app and all the testing) is done by 
ONE single person (me) as a side project, for free. So feel free to contribute.

To do:
-complete BOM
-assembly instructions
-how to use the screen luminosity tester
-how to use - guide
-how to use the app
In the next days this guide wil be update so if you do not find some info, just write me.

A 3D viewable model of the assembly is available here:
